My interests lie at the intersection of comparative politics - particularly governance and collective action - and behavioral economics, with a focus on African development. I am an incoming PhD student in Government at Harvard University and I am currently an Emerging Scholar at Princeton University through the [Emerging Scholars Program in Political Science](https://politics.princeton.edu/people/chinemelu-okafor), where I currently provide advanced statistical analysis to support the work of my faculty mentor, Professor LaFleur Stephens-Dougan. 

Previously, I was an [Empirical Studies of Conflict Research Specialist](https://esoc.princeton.edu/about-us/people/chinemelu-u-okafor) (2018-2019) in the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, under the direction of Professor Jake Shapiro and Professor Tarek Ghani.

Before coming to Princeton, I worked as a research assistant at the International Finance Corporation within the Thought Leadership Unit under the guidance of Dr. Tristan Reed and Dr. Alexandros Ragoussis. My previous professional experiences include positions at the World Bank, the United Nations, and The Royal African Society, among others.

In my spare time, I work as the Founder and President of [The Research in Color Foundation](https://www.researchincolor.org): a mentoring non-profit for racial and ethnic minorities looking to pursue doctoral degrees in economics, or economics-adjacent disciplines.

During my PhD I plan to examine topics such as ensuring the accountability of public officials, implementing community-responsive policymaking in ethnically diverse settings, understanding the historical roots of comparative African development, and using grassroots solutions to fight corruption in Sub-Saharan Africa.

I hold a Master's degree from the [George Washington University in Applied Economics](https://economics.columbian.gwu.edu/graduate) and a double Bachelor's degree in Economics and International Studies from [the University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/).
