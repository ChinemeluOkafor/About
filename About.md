I work at the intersection of politics - particularly governance and anti-corruption - and behavioral economics, with a focus on development policy. I am a Predoctoral Research Specialist at Princeton University through the [Emerging Scholars Program in Political Science](https://politics.princeton.edu/people/chinemelu-okafor), where I currently provide advanced statistical analysis to support the work of my faculty mentor, Professor LaFleur Stephens-Dougan. I plan to apply to Political Science Ph.D. programs in Fall 2020 with the hope of starting in Fall 2021.

Previously, I was an [Empirical Studies of Conflict Research Specialist](https://esoc.princeton.edu/authors/chinemelu-u-okafor) (2018-2019) in the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, under the direction of Professor Jake Shapiro and Professor Tarek Ghani.

Before coming to Princeton, I worked as a research assistant at the International Finance Corporation within the Thought Leadership Unit. My previous professional experiences include positions at the World Bank, the United Nations, and Thomson Reuters, among others.

I am also the Founder and President of [The Research in Color Foundation](https://www.researchincolor.org): a mentoring non-profit for racial and ethnic minorities looking to pursue doctoral degrees in economics, or economics-adjacent disciplines.

As a prospective Ph.D. student, I plan to examine topics such as ensuring the accountability of public officials, implementing community-responsive policymaking, and grassroots solutions to corruption and inequality.

I hold a Master's degree from the [George Washington University in Applied Economics](https://economics.columbian.gwu.edu/ma-applied-economics) and a double Bachelor's degree in Economics and International Studies from [the University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/).
